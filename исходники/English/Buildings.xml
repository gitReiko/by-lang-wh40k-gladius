	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces aircraft as well as generates ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/AircraftFlavor" value="This landing field was designed for larger craft—almost up to the intra-system scale—but with the endless warpstorms, it's been repurposed to house the Imperial air forces. Much like a Skyshield landing pad, it has limited field generators to protect grounded aircraft from incoming fire."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Construction" value="Labour Corps"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings and generates influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConstructionFlavor" value="Whilst the Administratum runs the entire Empire of man, the Departmento Munitorum is tasked solely with supplying the manpower and supplies for the Astra Militarum. Among their many tasks is the construction of large facilities, such as airfields or orbital stations. The poor grunts who have to do the work are the Labour Corps, indentured or penal workers and mind-wiped servitors."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/EnergyFlavor" value="Whilst the ancients may have split the atom, the Empire's Techpriests have had millennia to perfect the rituals by which they draw up power. The open-core Plasma Ioniser uses coolant-infusion systems to maintain an output of around 100 petawatts for up to a hundred days at a time—around 10,000 times that of the largest historical fission plant."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Food" value="Soylens Farm"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/FoodFlavor" value="Soylens viridians might be filling, nutritious and easy to grow in great vats—but as a foodstuff it has some drawbacks. First, it's utterly bland and flavourless. Second, it looks like green gloop. Third, it's made from any available organic matter. Persistent rumour has it that human corpses are not excluded."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Loyalty" value="Sanctum Imperialis"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LoyaltyFlavor" value="The local seat of the Imperial Cult may appear dark and gothic, but is in fact a hallowed place. Adorned by statues of saints, it is a venerated local symbol of the Emperor's godlike will, and provides inspiration to the nearby populace."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Headquarters" value="Basilica Administratum"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeadquartersFlavor" value="The central administrative building of any Imperial colony, the magnificent Basilica is a temple to bureaucracy. Generations of plain-clad clerks live and die amidst tottering tomes, deciding the fate of star systems with the feeble thump of their stamps. As the saying goes, the Inquisition may burn you, the Astartes smite you—but only the Adeptus Administratum can torment you for your entire life."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Heroes" value="Shrine of the Aquila"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HeroesFlavor" value="Far more than a mere statue, this great metal eagle was cast from the molten remains of space-faring vessels, and serves as an inspiration for those nearby. The Imperial troops that fight under the Aquila's ceaseless vigil find a new determination welling in their hearts, knowing that they are the last in a line of heroes that stretches across the stars."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Housing" value="Hab Block"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/HousingFlavor" value="The classic Imperial structure, these identikit city buildings are seen all over the Empire. They provide the minimum amount of shelter and comfort required for the people of the Imperium to eke out their short lives. At a colony's founding, sometimes they're built in situ—but more often, on remote planets, they're dropped directly from any colonising spaceships."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Infantry" value="Imperial Barracks"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as increases population limit and loyalty."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfantryFlavor" value="Whilst the training of recruits to the Imperial Guard has none of the harrowing horrors suffered by Astartes initiates, the Munitorum still has to drill the strictures of the Empire into the tithed men and women that make up most Guard regiments. Here, at the Barracks, a planet's unpromising conscripts are turned into the true Astra Militarum—by giving them uniforms, guns and perhaps even some training."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Influence" value="Cogitator Station"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/InfluenceFlavor" value="Though artificial intelligence is an abomination, long abhorred since the fall of the Men of Iron, the archaic data looms of the Adeptus Administratum bear little resemblance to ancient computers or even to the slim microprocessors used by the Techpriests of Mars. Cogitators functions are purely bureaucratic, their form immobile. Still, their capabilities are prized by every Imperial world purely for their inhuman memory."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Ore" value="Ore Extractor"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/OreFlavor" value="Depending on the planet, extraction of metal ores and valuable minerals is undertaken by anything ranging from ancient-tech machinery barely controlled by its Techpriest magos to thousands of Labour Corp workers, playing their part in the war to save mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Psykers" value="Psyker Coven"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PsykersDescription" value="Building that produces psykers as well as generates energy and influence."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PsykersFlavor" value="Whilst the warpstorm rages, the peacetime use of psykers—as astropaths, for long-range communication—is pointless. Similarly, without being able to reach the Black Ships, unwanted psykers can't be transported to Terra for sacrifice at the Golden Throne. Instead, most are executed, with a select few drafted into Imperial service as Sanctioned Psykers."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Research" value="Officio Tactica"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ResearchFlavor" value="Learning to be an officer of the Astra Militarum is a thankless, often lethal task. One of the safest postings is to the Officio Tactica, where the smartest tactical minds analyse ongoing military manouevres and refer to the copious texts of the Tactica Imperialis for well-tested advice. They also record their current campaigns, so that future generations might learn from them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Upgrades" value="Cult Mechanicus"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/UpgradesDescription" value="Building that produces Techpriest Enginseers and generates research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/UpgradesFlavor" value="The Techpriests worship of 'the Omnissiah', a machine-god, would surely be frowned upon, were it not for their usefulness. Instead, a tacit agreement is in place; the Techpriests acknowledge publicly that the Emperor was the Omnissiah and the Administratum agrees not to pry too closely."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/Vehicles" value="Manufactorum"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates ore and research."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VehiclesFlavor" value="To call an Imperial Manufactorum a 'factory' is akin to calling a Catachan Devil an insect. These cyclopean structures are huge, forbidding temples to the Machine God, wherein his miracles—here vehicles of war—are created. Inside them, lowly menials are doomed to never see the planet's surface, as they ceaselessly minister to the blessed engines of Mars."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Aircraft" value="Helhaunted Eyrie"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces heldrakes as well as generates loyalty and influence."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/AircraftFlavor" value="10,000 years ago the Heldrakes were fighter craft, piloted by the cream of the Adeptus Astartes. Now, they are hideous amalgams of man and machine, formed by millennia of war into dragon-like creatures that live to fight. This artificial eyrie allows the Warpsmiths and Master of Possession to monitor the Heldrakes and even attempt to replicate their age-old creation."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Construction" value="Warp Forge"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as generates ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ConstructionFlavor" value="Though the Warpsmiths’ Soul Forges are deep in the Realm of Chaos and hence inaccessible from Gladius, Chaos is nothing if not flexible. These Warp Forges are kept hot by the daily sacrifice of thousands of civilians, captured in the ruins of their fallen Hive World, to pull the warpbound buildings of Chaos into shimmering existence."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Cult" value="Cult of Chaos"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/CultDescription" value="Building that produces special Chaos units and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/CultFlavor" value="What are gods without followers? Here, Cultists and Dark Apostles alike plot to bring converts to the worship of Chaos—not a hard task on Gladius, once people see the inhuman Xenos, the undoubted effects of the Dark Gods’ powers, and the Daemonic shapes lingering in the chancel."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Energy" value="Warpbound Generator"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/EnergyFlavor" value="The fallen Techpriests of Chaos—now the Warpsmiths of the Dark Mechanicum—have had ten thousand years of calibrating their devices beyond the strictures of the Omnissiah. As powerful as a conventional Plasma Generator, this power source can be constructed quickly in situ. Its demon spirit draws energy from the flickering of a tear into the Empyrean to charge an infernal motion device."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Food" value="Renderer"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/FoodFlavor" value="Your troops are mostly beyond mortal desires—but the beastmen, mutants and slaves who run your cities aren’t. To provide food for them, bodies of all sorts are brought to the rendering stations, to provide pleasure for the Slaaneshi degenerates who run them and food for the massed workers—the stronger ones, at least. The weaker ones are dinner."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Loyalty" value="Meadow of Sorrow"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/LoyaltyFlavor" value="It can’t have been a follower of Khorne who named this plain a ‘meadow’—allegory isn’t a concomitant of the Blood God’s troops. Whoever coined it, the metaphor is apt—the carefully-planted rows, tended conscientiously, the gaps refilled as they empty. But the Slaaneshi garden these fields, constantly devising unholy pleasures for their God’s honour at the expense of its victims."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Headquarters" value="Dark Fortress"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HeadquartersFlavor" value="Even ten thousand years of heresy hasn’t entirely eliminated a Traitor’s training. Like their fellow Adeptus Astartes, Traitor Marines prefer to operate from a secure, well-constructed defensive position—preferably built by the Iron Warriors. This acts as a forward operations base for their raids and pillaging."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Heroes" value="Lord's Quarters"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HeroesFlavor" value="To call any Chaos Space Marine—murders, sadists, psychopaths and monsters to a man—a ‘hero’ is a contradiction-in-terms. But there are exceptional examples of them, the Sorcerers, Masters and Champions of Chaos who head up warbands and follow the diktats and commands of the Gods. Here, they congregate, under the watchful eyes of their Lord."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Housing" value="Captive Pens"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/HousingFlavor" value="Of all the gods, only Father Nurgle seems to care for his worshippers. And his worshippers care for the slaves who operate the city, confining them in the perfect quarters to breed disease and pestilence, whilst keeping enough of them physically and mentally robust to perform the many horrifying roles their fallen Astartes masters demand of them."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Infantry" value="Abominator's Genelab"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as generates food and research."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/InfantryFlavor" value="Not all Chaos Space Marines date from the 30th millenium—others are recruited from civilians, brutally altered with geneseed taken from a fallen Marine. At this genelab, fallen Apothecaries operate on the strongest cultists drawn from Gladius’ ruined Hives. The few who survive the Abominators’ operations are implanted with Progenoid glands and recruited as new Chaos Space Marines."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Influence" value="Altar to Chaos"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/InfluenceFlavor" value="Chaos Undivided is a contradiction in terms. Looking at the Daemons of each God—the giggling Horrors, the droning Plaguebearers, the raging Bloodletters, the gasping Daemonettes— nothing could be more dissimilar. Yet this altar reveals the brutal commonality behind Chaos: A dark stone. Gore-soaked ground. The raised knife. And the bacchanalia."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Ore" value="Slave Mines"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/OreFlavor" value="Even the Orks have better ways of getting metal out of the ground than this—but then, the Lords of Chaos’ concern with their servants is less about preventing suffering and more about ensuring it. These mines are crudely cruel, designed to elicit hope, before crushing it. They farm tortured souls for Chaos as much as they do ore."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Research" value="Archive of the Ways"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ResearchFlavor" value="On Daemon worlds, storytellers tells of a warp-lost library that contains all of the thoughts of Tzeentch. In its richness, they say, it rivals the Aeldari’s Black Library or the meaningless infinity of the Library of Babel. Whether Tzeentch’s memoirs exist, an Archive of the Ways is a real-world reflection of that false-world myth—a place where truths can be created, not discovered."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/Vehicles" value="Infernal Fabricator"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/VehiclesFlavor" value="Normally confined to the Soul Forges of the Warp, these incomprehensible mechanoid structures are responsible for the creation of all Daemon vehicles. Here, Mechatendril-wreathed Warpsmiths oversee the breaking and corruption of Machine Spirits of captured Imperial vehicles, as well as the forcible incorporation of Lesser Daemons, machinery and tortured flesh into Daemon Engines."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="From the shanty town huts of the Orks, to the billion-person hives of the Imperium, to the space-faring Craftworlds of the Aeldari, to the ancient mastaba of the Necrons, almost every race produces structures to satisfy their needs—whether that's construction, shelter, or merely pride. Perhaps only the Tyranids, in their insatiable search for new biological materials, lack permanent structures, instead relying on a range of semi-mobile birthing organisms..."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces aircraft as well as generates energy, research and influence."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/AircraftFlavor" value="Raised high above the ground, this coiled Webway opening enables Aeldari aircraft to travel straight from the immaterium to Gladius Prime whilst having a slower transition of air pressure, composition and local gravity compared to the unearthly forms present in the twisted  space between the stars."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Construction" value="Bonesingers Chantry"/>
	<entry name="Eldar/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as harvests ore and generates research."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/ConstructionFlavor" value="Many of the paths that Aeldari walk in their long lives are non-violent—indeed, most are, for the Craftworld Aeldari were those who rejected the hedonistic lives of their peers for one of contemplation. Bonesingers are artisans who psychically manipulate Wraithbone into the structures and machinery that Aeldari use."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Energy" value="Thermo Plasma Generator"/>
	<entry name="Eldar/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/EnergyFlavor" value="More elegant by far than its Imperial equivalents, this portable plasma generator has been brought through the webway at great risk. It uses similar technology to the Imperial version, but has a much higher output for a much smaller device."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Food" value="Isha's Gardens"/>
	<entry name="Eldar/FoodDescription" value="Building that harvests food."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/FoodFlavor" value="In Aeldari myth, Isha was the mother of the Aeldari, who brought them into existence and shielded them from Khaine. She is also thought to be one of the three surviving Aeldari deities, trapped in the Chaos God Nurgle’s domain. In these gardens on Gladius, Aeldari who walk the Path of the Artisan follow her teachings and grow healthy, fresh food for the local Aeldari forces. Their contribution to Aeldari life is regarded as just as valuable as any warrior or seer."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/HeadquartersFlavor" value="The Webway riddles Gladius Prime, but many of the gateways have been lost. Even those that survive are unimaginably ancient, but still they stand, ignored by the younger races. Around them, the Aeldari build emplacements and machinery, to stabilise the gateways renewed connection with the immaterium and defend it against incursion."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Heroes" value="Shrine of Khaine"/>
	<entry name="Eldar/HeroesDescription" value="Building that produces heroes as well as generates influence and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/HeroesFlavor" value="Though Asuryan was the chief deity of the Aeldari, his brother Khaine was his match in power. All warriors devote themselves to Khaine, with those who are lost on the Path of War becoming his Exarchs and Autarchs. In contrast, those lost on the Path of the Seer become Farseers, unable to return to the other paths they may have walked—and the Aeldari do not consider the sacrifice of freedom for power worthwhile."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Housing" value="Ghost Halls"/>
	<entry name="Eldar/HousingDescription" value="Building that increases population limit."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/HousingFlavor" value="As Asuryan was dying, consumed by Slaanesh, he blessed the Aeldari; he gave them long life and great psychic power; but he also doomed their fertility. Over time, Aeldari numbers have dwindled until now, when the great halls that once housed millions only house thousands. Here, on Gladius Prime, the ghost halls provide a taste of luxurious Aeldari living for those not fighting in the field."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as generates loyalty and research."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/InfantryFlavor" value="Asuryan, the Phoenix King, was the chief of the Aeldari Gods and the last to be consumed by Slaanesh during the fall of the Aeldari. He has long been an inspiration to the Craftworld Aeldari, who often refer to themselves as ‘Asuryani’. At this muster ground, new arrivals to Gladius are equipped and assigned to squads before being tested in the field."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/InfluenceDescription" value="Building that generates influence."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/InfluenceFlavor" value="When one sees the tracery of wraithbone growing into the sky; when one hears an  unearthly song from a labourer who has lived longer than the Imperium has existed; when one sees an elegant figure talking with authority about the future to come; perhaps you might concede that the Aeldari have good reason to behave with arrogance..."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Loyalty" value="Cairn of Ulthanesh"/>
	<entry name="Eldar/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/LoyaltyFlavor" value="Eldanesh was the first Aeldari. He and his kinsman Ulthanesh were two greatest heroes of Aeldari mythology, battling the new people’s enemies alongside Khaine, the God of War. Eventually, the two heroes fell out and Ulthanesh went his own way. But when Khaine killed Eldanesh in rage, Ulthanesh fought alongside his kinsman’s house against the god and became proverbial for his loyalty."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/OreDescription" value="Building that harvests ore."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/OreFlavor" value="The smith god Vaul was known for his fantastic creations. Though the surviving myths focus mostly on his weapons (notably his hundred swords), he created many devices the Aeldari still use today—like this automated mine, which requires the barest supervision to extract the ore needed for his other creations."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/Research" value="Spirit Ossuary"/>
	<entry name="Eldar/ResearchDescription" value="Building that generates research."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/ResearchFlavor" value="Here, spiritseers interrogate the spiritstones of the dead. The Aeldari do not invent and they rarely research these days—their technology is mostly stagnant, having been inherited from the Old Ones, but unlike the Imperial priesthood of Mars they do at least understand its function. Here they can consult the wisest minds of their history for solutions to any problem—though their response isn’t always clear or quick."/>

	<entry name="Eldar/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as harvests ore and generates research."/>
	<entry name="Eldar/VehiclesFlavor" value="This extension to the Webway Portal allows larger vehicles to access Gladius Prime. Without it, the Aeldari forces would just be infantry and jetbikes—enough for a Harlequin Troupe or a Biel-Tan vanguard perhaps, but not for a true war effort."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/AircraftFlavor" value="If the Necron are dreaded across the known universe, their aircraft are doubly feared.

	<entry name="Necrons/EnergyFlavor" value="Whatever the baroque technology is that the Necron use in their great Energy Cores, it outshines even the Imperial Plasma Ioniser for sheer power—and it needs to, given that the Necron dynasty depends upon its power supplies as other races do on water or food."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/LoyaltyDescription" value="Building that increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/LoyaltyFlavor" value="While the Stelae talk of the ancient Necrontyr's victories and glories, this Shrine tells a darker story. It details their conversion to metal and subjugation by the C'tan, and of Szarekh the Silent King and his long-planned betrayal and destruction of the soul-eating Star Gods.
