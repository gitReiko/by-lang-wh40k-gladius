	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedAstraMilitarum" value="The troops of the traitor Astra Militarum are scattered and leaderless—without the firm command of their heretical leaders, the war is over. Now we must focus our efforts on securing Gladius Prime for the Imperium."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedChaosSpaceMarines" value="The heretics are… dead? From lasgun fire and true grit! The Astra Militarum army celebrates long into the night. In the morning, the Commissar reminds them of the fate of those who are exposed to infectious disease or heresy..."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedEldar" value="However many million years of civilisation and learning and here they lie, all that learning lost, dead in the dust of an alien world. It was foul xenos learning anyway, so the better that we took out of the universe."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedNecrons" value="The green light fades from the last artificial eye, as the last Necron gives up the fight. After immeasurable aeons of war, their cities are crushed, their troops atomised, and their leaders slain. Though beneath the planet's surface, millions more still slumber in deathly unquiet, let's call this a victory."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedOrks" value="The Greenskin menace has been defeated. Though that is not to say that it has been eliminated. Even though every Ork, Grot and Snotling is dead, their corpses are already spreading the spores that will raise a new army of Greenskins in a generation. With lasgun, flamer and battle cannon we will be waiting for them."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedSpaceMarines" value="The fabled Adeptus Astartes, the legendary warriors of the Imperium, lie dead to a man. No apothecary remains to gather their geneseed for the next generation, no mission from distant Terra can rescue them. The defence of Gladius Prime falls to you—though even if you succeed, the Inquisition will have questions to ask about what happened to the Space Marine Chapter station here..."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedTau" value="They sought to corrupt you, the pathetic xenogens, but they couldn’t persuade a single guardsman. Your machines shall grind their skulls to bonemeal for your fields, melt their machines back to ore—all for the good of mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDefeatedTyranids" value="With the death of the last synapse creature, the Tyranids have turned from a horrifying army of synchronised killing, into feral animals. Like the Catachan Devils, these animals are still vicious and deadly, but without co-ordination, they pose no long-term threat to mankind."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredAstraMilitarum" value="You've encountered another group of Imperial Guard, equipped and trained much like your own men. However, they do not respond to your comms and immediately behave in a hostile manner. No matter whether they are traitors, heretics or Xenos pawns, they must be wiped from the face of Gladius."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredChaosSpaceMarines" value="Heretics! The Guardsmen quail in horror. To see these fallen humans isn't only to know that the Emperor was fallible, that his Space Marines could fail—but also to know there is no way that the Imperium will allow the Guardmen to walk away from this. At best, mind-wiping awaits the Astra Militarum, at worst, mass euthanasia."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredEldar" value="The fey Aeldari meddle even here, on an Imperial Hive World? They are weak and they are effete and they should have stayed to die of old age on their Craftworld. But if they must come, we will help them die here instead."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredNecrons" value="Necrons, here, on an Imperial world? Who knows how long have they been sleeping beneath the surface, making their inscrutable plans? Your only hope is to overcome them before they wake their sleeping millions and they make this planet theirs once again."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredOrks" value="Meeting Orks is almost a relief for a Guardsman—after all, their behaviour is minutely detailed in The Imperial Infantryman's Uplifting Primer and most veterans will have encountered and fought them before. The men that survived generally report that Orks are unhealthily interested in where their next fight is coming from—if you can avoid conflict with them, they will actually weaken over time."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="The greatest warriors the galaxy has ever known, the Space Marines are committed to rooting out the enemies of mankind wherever they may be, even amongst their allies. This Chapter won't even answer your comms—sadly you must assume that they consider you heretics or traitors, and prepare for war."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredTau" value="If the insidious whispers of heresy weren’t enough, here are xenogen who promise something more than glory and servitude in the name of the Emperor. We have a simple solution to their problem—double the ammunition allocation for each commissar."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumDiscoveredTyranids" value="Through the experiments of Tech-Priests Genetors, the ravening swarm has come to Gladius Prime. But without support from their Hive-Ships, they are not the overwhelming force they have been elsewhere. Perhaps here, Guardsmen alone will be enough to defeat them."/>

Creed, Lord Castellan of Cadia<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>The Astra Militarum, commonly known as the Imperial Guard, is the primary fighting force of the Imperium of Man. Across a galaxy of a hundred billion stars, there must be billions of Guardsmen at least—yet even the Departmento Munitorum on Terra, which oversees this immense force, has no real idea of how many troops there are at any one time. A safe estimate is to say that there are millions of regiments.<br/><br/>What the Imperial Guard lack in strength, courage and resilience, they make up in numbers, organisation and fighting vehicles—the Guard's wide range of tanks is rightly feared. The manpower of the Astra Militarum is predominantly human, though they do employ stable mutant strains, such as the giant Bullgryns. All these troops are equipped with the best mass-produced weaponry that the Techpriest war manufactories can provide, though it is often backward compared to that wielded by their enemies.<br/><br/>Across the vastness of galactic space, the vast majority of the Imperium's battles involve the Astra Militarum. It is by their actions and endless sacrifice that mankind has claimed and held its place in the universe."/>

Here an ancient Servo-skull inches above cluttered, dust-caked shelves, casting light for a shuffling scribe. The scribe finds the archive he is looking for and extracts an ancient dataslate.

He pauses for a moment and, in a shaky hand, annotates the entry.<br/><br/>“Gladius Prime: main planet of the Gladius System, Segmentum Obscurus, Ixaniad Sector.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarumWonEliminationFlavor" value="The colony has been saved—well, what remains of it. The few remaining Xenos are fleeing to the corners of the planet. Hunting them down should be well within your veterans' capabilities. Truly, you are a war leader to rival Macharius!<br/><br/>With the eventual clearing of the warpstorms, the planet will return to Imperial rule. Rogue Traders will arrive, its cities will be rebuilt, the skulking civilian population will be bolstered by colonists from nearby sectors. Within a generation, it will be a viable colony again, sending its Imperial tithe like any other. Within ten generations, it may be a rich world supplying its own regiment to the Imperium. Within a thousand, it may be a depleted hive world, rife with corruption and filth, a cramped, impoverished home for future humanity. All this, for the glory of mankind—and for the Emperor!"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumWonQuestFlavor" value="You will never know why the Tech-priest betrayed you and the Imperium, what he was trying to achieve, and what function the artefact on his gun-ship truly served. But with his elimination and the dispersal of the warpstorms, communications have been restored.<br/><br/>Yet the planet's few surviving astropaths have astounding news, straight from Terra itself. Whilst the warp storms shielded your planet, the wider Empire has seen great upheaval. Cadia has fallen, the galaxy has been rent asunder by the warp, and Roboute Guilliman, foremost of the Emperor's Primarchs, has awoken from his ten thousand-year slumber.<br/><br/>Despite this, your army will not be joining Guilliman's crusades. Gladius Prime's unique artefacts and strategic location mean you have been permanently assigned here—to protect the planet and the explorators, come what may."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDefeatedEldar" value="We walk from corpse to corpse, crushing the spirit stones under the boots of our power armour. Step, a gift to Slaanesh, step, another. Soon all your pitiful race will be swallowed by She Who Thirsts and we will step closer to our reward."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDefeatedNecrons" value="A victory not of ethos, but of survival—they would crush us for fear of the Warp, not us. Now Gladius Prime's tombs lie quiescent and we can focus on our task."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDefeatedTau" value="Little xenogen, we didn’t hate you because you were alien. We didn’t hate you because you were moral. We hated you because you claimed purity and resistance. Now, in the warp, we will test what remains of you, against your claims."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDiscoveredAstraMilitarum" value="Hearken to the words of the Dark Apostles, little Imperials. For your days of war and slaughter will seem innocent and placid compared to the horrors to come.

So decadent was your folly that the great god Slaanesh was born from your delicious lusts and consumed you whole. Fear not, old xenos, we know what to do with you."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDiscoveredNecrons" value="Soulless machines are of no interest to our masters—incorruptible ones even less so. Yet we must not underestimate them. They loathe the Warp and the Old Ones who spawned it. Be wary of their hatred."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDiscoveredOrks" value="A distraction, but a very dangerous one. If it wasn't for their green blood and cheerful demeanour, we might be looking at a Khornate warband."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="Pandering, tedious, moralistic, unambitious, idiotically loyal, holier-than-thou, craven, pusillanimous, inhuman… oh, our brothers.

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesDiscoveredTyranids" value="The swarm. Incorruptible, indomitable, alien, and one great motive force behind it all. Like a Chaos God present in the materium. How could one not admire it?"/>

The fallen Primarchs (now Daemon Princes of Chaos) lead their forces in endless internecine war for resources, slaves or favour in the eyes of the gods.<br/><br/>However, recently, the balance of power has shifted. With the fall of the fortress-world of Cadia, the Traitor Legions can come and go at will—and with the birth of the massive Warp storm called the Great Rift, the Imperium is divided and weakened. The hive world of Gladius Prime—isolated in a distant corner of the galaxy—should be an easy target..."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesLostFlavor" value="Here the long war is over. Your ten thousand year heresy has been ground into the mud and dust of Gladius Prime's battlefields and the Dark Gods will be denied their planetary prize—at least until they find a new warband to send.

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesWonEliminationFlavor" value="Your opponents are now long dead. From your vantage atop a throne of skulls, you watch as the sacrifices happen. Khorne's executions are brutal, Slaanesh's are agonizing delights, Tzeentch asks only for their secrets, and Nurgle lets them live with his diseased blessing. Each ritual brings more souls to the Dark Gods and more power to you, lord of this new planet."/>

Whatever secrets or stored spirits previously existed in its infinity circuits are gone. They have been fed into the spirit of this new being, a Daemon Engine the scale of a planet. Already the world is shifting, merging into the Warp storm surrounding it, the Realm of Chaos itself. Soon, Gladius Prime will be a Daemon planet like no other."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="In the Imperium's 41st millenium of existence, the challenges humanity faces are variously internal and external, but uniformly terrifying. The old enemy, Chaos, eternally threatens the weakened armies of the Astra Militarum, Adeptus Astartes, Adeptus Sororitas and Adeptus Mechanicus. Hordes of Orks, Tyranids, and other Xenos species predate on the isolated Imperial worlds. And Aeldari, Necron and T'au carry out their inscrutable plans, seemingly careless of the loss of human life they inflict."/>

	<entry name="EldarDefeatedChaosSpaceMarines" value="With every worshipper who dies, we merely strengthen the storms in the warp that constitute lust, anger, plague and plot.

Weak, slow, stupid… but fertile and still our likely successors. Fear their war engines, primitive though they are."/>
	<entry name="EldarDiscoveredChaosSpaceMarines" value="Mankind is weak.

In their desperation, the Old Ones seeded the galaxy with psychic races, thus awakening the horrors of the warp, and the Necrons—weakened by a simultaneous battle of liberation from the C'tan—retreated to their homeworlds.<br/><br/>There, falling into hibernation, they slumbered for untold time. As other races were born and drove themselves to extinction, they lay deep and undisturbed in multitudinous worlds, tended and defended in their not-sleep by their monstrous Canoptek automata.<br/><br/>Now, across the galaxy, they are awakening. Even here, this Crownworld's master circuits are stirring. The Necrons—now unthinking machines, save for their few Lords and Triarchs—are arming themselves for war again. Their technology is millennia ahead of that of the galaxy's younger races. Soon, legions of sinister, advanced war machines will pour from the tombs buried beneath the planet to conquer and enslave—nothing mortal is safe."/>
	<entry name="NecronsLostFlavor" value="You waited millennia to test yourselves against the Old Ones' progeny... and failed. Your armies are destroyed, the raised extrusions of your cities obliterated. Now the survivors are retreating to their impregnable tombs, whilst the Canoptek automata seal the way behind them. Elsewhere, beneath the planet's surface, tens of thousands of your kind still sleep. Perhaps, in a few millennia more, you will wake together. Then—finally then—the galaxy will be yours."/>

The Old Ones? The C'tan? With time, you're sure the psychic maelstrom will subside and you will find out. When it does, you will be prepared, your armies replenished and rebuilt.

The rest of the Old Ones' spawned races surrendered or died with their cities when it was deployed against them. These slaves now mine the planet for its rich artefacts.<br/><br/>The warpstorm still looms overhead.

Heavily-muscled, aggressive, eight-foot-tall fungal thugs with a love of warfare, the Orks were a spacefaring peril long before the human Imperium entered the galactic scene. Spread evenly across the galaxy, for the most part they are an irritant to any other inhabitants, like lazy, belligerent neighbours. But occasionally, as a swarm of locusts, the scattered tribes and clans form into a Waaagh!—something between a crusade and a riot—and devastate entire sectors until they run out of things to fight and fall instead into internecine warfare.<br/><br/>That's not to say the Orks are completely primitive. Despite their thuggish demeanour, they possess a low intelligence augmented by genetically-coded technical excellence. Their technicians—called Meks—build raggedy, ugly vehicles, buildings, guns and spaceships, which should fall apart at first use, but actually perform their job surprisingly effectively. Imperial scholars believe this is due to the pervasive psychic power of the Orks, which simply fills in the technical gaps that should prevent all their devices from working.<br/><br/>In battle, Orks attacks are undisciplined rampages, full of boisterous chanting and joy of warfare. Their crude weapons and blunt tactics mingled with their resilience and sheer numbers make them a dangerous foe. Even when defeated, their bodies spread spores which, in time, will grow into more Orks, plus their servant races—Grots, Squigs and Snots—which keep them alive. Even when every last Ork is dead, the Orks are far from defeated."/>
	<entry name="OrksLostFlavor" value="As the last Ork keels reluctantly dead to the ground, the Waaagh! finally falls silent.

And there's never an end to the Orks. Even though you and your Boyz are returning to the mud, your dying bodies will spread spores to every corner of this planet.

By their deaths, they deny themselves the liberation that is only to be found in total surrender to the Greater Good.”<br/>  — Aun'Va, Master of the Undying Spirit<style name='Default'/><br/><br/>The T’au Empire had never faced such an existential threat. On one side lay the relentless hunger of the Tyranids; on others, the Imperium’s impassable flame-wall, the Sautekh Dynasty of Necrons, and the growing Great Rift, Mont’yhe’va, Devourer of Hope. How could they survive?<br/><br/>The solution was the Fourth Expansion, led by the great Commander Surestrike. He would lead his Fire Warriors to claim new worlds far from T’au. They might be a young empire, a small people—but they fight for the greater good of all species and they could not fail.<br/><br/>Yet, disaster struck with the T’au’s new warp drives. Space twisted, tore, opened, span insanity and monstrosity into reality, swallowing the fleet. One ship was taken, moved by many hands, spat out alone. Above a ruined Imperial hive world, far too far from T’au. Gladius Prime. Now these T’au must fight just to survive."/>
	<entry name="TauLostFlavor" value="Gladius Prime is doomed, that is clear. But its doom extends further now, for it will never know the Greater Good.

	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredOrks" value="The Hive Mind can recognise in the Ork race a kindred creature, but unconscious.

	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredSpaceMarines" value="The Hive Mind must feel hunger, but also caution. Though inside their metal shells these creatures are the same as the smaller humans, they have proved themselves far more capable and difficult to assimilate.

	<entry name="TyranidsDiscoveredTau" value="The Hive Mind has tasted this before. Only a morsel, though on a far away fringe of the galaxy—but it was sated. Beyond some advanced swarm control mechanisms, this genetic data is uninteresting, unvaried, tedious. Still, the biomass will be valuable."/>

Their hive fleets stretch out like tendrils, great chitinous bio-ships drifting in brooding silence. Once the remorseless shoals of the bioships detect the presence of a prey world, they close upon their target, grasping it like some many-tentacled beast seizing its food. In the ensuing invasion, the world will be consumed, for the Tyranids hunger for all living matter. There is no escape from this final embrace and when the Tyranids finally depart, they leave behind a barren world, a scoured ball of rock now devoid of anything that lives.<br/><br/>A Tyranid hive fleet consists of millions of living starcraft, each home to untold numbers of monstrosities evolved from the geno-organs of the ship's reproductive chambers. All the creatures serve the entity that is the ship, and the ship exists only as part of the horrific super-organism that is the fleet. Even when dead, organic matter is reconstituted back into the ship, along with captured biomass from the invaded planet. It is then all dissolved into a rich biological gruel used to make new Tyranid creatures, each ready to serve the Hive Mind and begin the feeding process anew.<br/><br/>But on Gladius, the Tyranids are few and scattered, brought here by meddling men. The warp storms keep them distant from the will of the Hive Mind and the Imperial citizens think of them merely as pests. They should worry more..."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsLostFlavor" value="The Hive Mind would not consider this a defeat. A small loss of biomass, yes, a tendril vanished of its myriad remaining in the darkness between the stars.
