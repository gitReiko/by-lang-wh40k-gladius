	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/BasiliskFlavor" value="When the Imperial Guard go to war, they march to the thunderous report of batteries of Basilisks whose guns can flatten cities and end worlds.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ChimeraFlavor" value="The Chimera is the most prolific and popular armoured transport used by the Imperial Guard. It is rugged, versatile, and easy to produce in huge numbers. For thousands of years it has been accepted wisdom that the Chimera punches well above its weight in a firefight; the tank itself mounts a variety of punishing anti-personnel weaponry, while passengers can lay down additional fire from its spacious top hatch and flank-mounted lasgun arrays."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ImperialStrongpointFlavor" value="An Imperial Bastion is an imposing edifice built from foot-thick ferrocrete and the remains of faithful servants of the Imperium. As they are relatively easy to construct, some planets boast networks of Bastions that span entire continents. Built to withstand orbital strikes and artillery bombardments, there are few weapons capable of razing them in a single blow. It is with good reason that such fortresses often form the cornerstone of a planet's defensive strategy."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LemanRussBattleTankFlavor" value="The Leman Russ battle tank is an ironclad declaration of might made manifest.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VoidShieldGeneratorDescription" value="Fortification that shields units in range."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/VoidShieldGeneratorFlavor" value="Void shields are normally localised force fields reserved for protecting the monolithic Titans of the Adeptus Mechanicus, but static generators can be erected to serve as an aegis for other targets of vital import. The largest Void Shield generators can even project an invisible bubble of power across a large area of the battlefield, sheltering both troops and strategically vital battlefield locations by absorbing or deflecting the energy of incoming munitions."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ChaosCultistFlavor" value="The cultists of Chaos can be found, in one form or another, almost anywhere the Imperium has spread. At first glance, they are indistinguishable from normal men, but under their clothes, their flesh is tattooed and branded with sigils that hurt the eyes of any faithful who look upon them. When the Chaos Space Marines come to a planet, the true colours of the cultists are revealed. The powers of darkness are ever quick to promise glory, and even the lowliest initiate knows that to fight alongside such legendary warriors is to court the gaze of the gods."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ChaosLandRaiderFlavor" value="The Chaos Land Raider is the heaviest ground vehicle in a Chaos Space Marine army. Its adamantine and ceramite plates can withstand all but the deadliest anti-tank weaponry, and the blessings of the Warpsmiths keep it at peak efficiency.

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ChaosRhinoFlavor" value="The Rhino is the most common transport of the Space Marines, and the same can be said of the Heretic Astartes, for this machine is so ruggedly constructed it can see hundreds of years of warfare and still function at peak efficiency. The tank's chassis is based upon a Standard Template Construct, meaning that it is relatively simple to build, maintain and repair. Over the ten thousand years since the Long War began, the Rhino has seen continued use as the favoured transport of the Chaos Space Marines. They will even go so far as to loot them from defeated Imperial armies, though they will burn them clean of Imperial insignia as quickly as possible and festoon the stolen vehicles with spikes, blades and gory trophies taken from the dismembered bodies of their previous owners."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/DaemonPrinceDescription" value="Monstrous hero that cripples foes with psychic powers before clawing them to death."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/DaemonPrinceFlavor" value="Daemon Princes are infernal monsters that tower over the mortals they lead to battle. These paragons of evil take many forms, though all exude a palpable aura of terror and power. In battle, a Daemon Prince strides through the pitiful bullets of the enemy without pause, his unnatural laughter driving men to the edge of fear. Warp energy sizzles from his eyes, and black flames curl from his mouth as he speaks dread phrases that kill as sure as any blade. These are creatures of nightmare—a living expression of Chaos given form."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/DefilerDescription" value="Enormous walker unit with devastating melee and ranged weaponry."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/DefilerFlavor" value="Defilers are truly massive beasts of war, twice the size of most other Daemon Engines and with a temperament to match. The ground shivers and melts as they stalk towards their foes on six massive, segmented legs, their great pincer-arms twitching and snipping with an impatient need to slice through warm flesh. The Defiler's crab-like body supports a daemonic torso that carries an array of deadly weaponry, ranging from reaper autocannons to racks of highly explosive missiles. It is the battle cannon mounted in its chest turret, however, that is undoubtedly its most potent armament. Each hell-forged shell that thunders out from its growling muzzle is capable of crippling a squad of Space Marines in a single earth-shaking blast."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/KhorneBerzerkerFlavor" value="It was the gruesome experiments of Angron, Primarch of the World Eaters, that led to the creation of the first Berzerkers. By the ritual lobotomisation of his warriors, he removed all sense of fear and danger and then heightened the rush his soldiers experienced in combat. When the Legion swore itself to Khorne, the Berzerkers were no longer bound by Imperial battle doctrine and were given full rein to exercise their bloodthirsty skills. They have since become the ultimate close combat shock troops, entering an uncontrollable frenzy in the heat of battle."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/MasterOfPossessionFlavor" value="Masters of Possession lead warbands of devoted warriors in pursuit of untold power. These sorcerous figures have mastered the darkest and most blasphemous lore: the art of using hosts of living flesh to house daemonic spirits. It is they who perform the profane ceremonies of binding that imbue the Daemonkin with their warp-born power. Gouging a breach in the fabric of realspace, the Master of Possession draws a willing entity from the immaterium, channelling its terrible energies into the body of a supplicant or the chassis of a war machine. So thoroughly are these dread figures steeped in blasphemous sorcery that where they walk, reality itself recoils."/>

Their eyes glow with balefire as ectoplasmic drool drizzles from their fanged maws. Their thick front limbs end in articulated claws powerful enough to tear a Dreadnought limb from limb. Should they catch a squad of infantry, they will scissor them apart or crush them into paste with a flex of their massive talons."/>

	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarines/ObliteratorFlavor" value="The monstrous warriors of the Obliterator cults are a blasphemy against nature and Machine God alike. Their forms are so altered, so thoroughly conjoined with the tools of war, that every cell in their bodies thrills with a spark of mechanical life. Only the Dark Mechanicum have mastered the complete fusion of metal and flesh, melding the inert and the animate together on a spiritual level in order to form something far greater than mere cybernetics. Because of their Chaos-born powers, Obliterators are capable of not only absorbing weaponry into themselves, but also of manifesting munitions from their titanium-laced flesh."/>

Grotesque amalgams of metal, flesh and daemonic entities, these monstrosities hiss and snarl as they scuttle towards their prey. Fleshy tongues flap from snarling maws and soulflayer tendrils lash back and forth, all tasting the air for the scent of their enemies' fear.

	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="Reading the histories of the 41st millenium, one might assume that the galaxy only experiences conflict. That's far from the truth—most civilians of the Imperium live and die in peace.

His eyes glow like embers, and as he moves, his body of burning iron crackles and spits fire, while tendrils of smoke and cinders wreath him like a dark cloak. His mere presence incites the Aeldari around him into a black and merciless rage, the fires of the Bloody-Handed God’s battle lust crackling within them."/>

Stranger by far is his co-pilot, for the Wraithfighter is crewed by a dead Aeldari soul who controls weapons that would drive a mortal insane.

The gift of death he brings to those who threaten the craftworld.

No matter each Battlewagon's individual peculiarities, all fulfil the essential role of armoured attack vehicle.

Completely lethal in gun battles, boarding actions and the like, a mob of Gitz opening fire is nothing short of cataclysmic.

Though other Orks mock the Meganobz for wearing so much armour, only the dullest would do so within earshot.

Furthermore, an Ork with teef to spare will take existing kit to the nearest Mek in the hope of having damage repaired, and maybe some kustomising done.

Instead, these floating creatures follow behind the Tyranid attack; they are typically created only after a prey world's protectors have been defeated and the swarm is in the process of devouring the planet's biomass. On those few occasions that a survivor has seen a Malanthrope and somehow escaped, they have brought with them a tale of horror. They report seeing these giants drift across corpse-strewn battlefields, but unlike other Tyranids, which mindlessly devour everything in their way, Malanthropes seem to selectively search through the slain—as to what they are searching for, none can say."/>

It is armed with four huge razor-sharp claws, each capable of slicing clean through a battle tank, and heavily protected by chitin plates, in places up to 30 cm thick.

Striding ominously towards their prey, these alien giants deal death from afar, shattering enemy battle lines with merciless salvos of bio-weapons fire. The only way to stop the unrelenting slaughter is to slay the beast, but a Tyrannofex has the fortitude of a living battle fortress and is heedless of all but the heaviest enemy ordnance.

A Zoanthrope's link to the synaptic web is such that, by flexing the merest part of its mind, it can rain incandescent power on the enemy, projecting destructive bolts of energy that boils through adamantium plate and disintegrates flesh with equal ease."/>
