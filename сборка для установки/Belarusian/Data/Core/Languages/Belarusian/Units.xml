	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/BanebladeFlavor" value="The Baneblade is an unmistakable icon of the Imperium's armoured supremacy, and many of these honoured machines have served in countless war zones across several millennia of war. Possessed of overwhelming firepower, exceptionally thick armour, and a roaring power-plant that allows it to surge into battle with surprising speed, the Baneblade is a truly deadly foe in any conflict."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/BasiliskFlavor" value="When the Imperial Guard go to war, they march to the thunderous report of batteries of Basilisks whose guns can flatten cities and end worlds. Instantly recognisable for the long, looming barrel of its earthshaker cannon, the Basilisk boasts a prodigious range."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ChimeraFlavor" value="The Chimera is the most prolific and popular armoured transport used by the Imperial Guard. It is rugged, versatile, and easy to produce in huge numbers. For thousands of years it has been accepted wisdom that the Chimera punches well above its weight in a firefight; the tank itself mounts a variety of punishing anti-personnel weaponry, while passengers can lay down additional fire from its spacious top hatch and flank-mounted lasgun arrays."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ImperialStrongpointFlavor" value="An Imperial Bastion is an imposing edifice built from foot-thick ferrocrete and the remains of faithful servants of the Imperium. As they are relatively easy to construct, some planets boast networks of Bastions that span entire continents. Built to withstand orbital strikes and artillery bombardments, there are few weapons capable of razing them in a single blow.

At first glance, they are indistinguishable from normal men, but under their clothes, their flesh is tattooed and branded with sigils that hurt the eyes of any faithful who look upon them.

The tank's chassis is based upon a Standard Template Construct, meaning that it is relatively simple to build, maintain and repair. Over the ten thousand years since the Long War began, the Rhino has seen continued use as the favoured transport of the Chaos Space Marines. They will even go so far as to loot them from defeated Imperial armies, though they will burn them clean of Imperial insignia as quickly as possible and festoon the stolen vehicles with spikes, blades and gory trophies taken from the dismembered bodies of their previous owners."/>

These paragons of evil take many forms, though all exude a palpable aura of terror and power.

Warp energy sizzles from his eyes, and black flames curl from his mouth as he speaks dread phrases that kill as sure as any blade.

The Defiler's crab-like body supports a daemonic torso that carries an array of deadly weaponry, ranging from reaper autocannons to racks of highly explosive missiles. It is the battle cannon mounted in its chest turret, however, that is undoubtedly its most potent armament. Each hell-forged shell that thunders out from its growling muzzle is capable of crippling a squad of Space Marines in a single earth-shaking blast."/>

These sorcerous figures have mastered the darkest and most blasphemous lore: the art of using hosts of living flesh to house daemonic spirits. It is they who perform the profane ceremonies of binding that imbue the Daemonkin with their warp-born power. Gouging a breach in the fabric of realspace, the Master of Possession draws a willing entity from the immaterium, channelling its terrible energies into the body of a supplicant or the chassis of a war machine. So thoroughly are these dread figures steeped in blasphemous sorcery that where they walk, reality itself recoils."/>

Stranger by far is his co-pilot, for the Wraithfighter is crewed by a dead Aeldari soul who controls weapons that would drive a mortal insane.

As it ploughs through the enemy ranks, the Daemon Engine wields its roaring cleaver with a speed and skill that is entirely horrifying in something so huge. Entire ranks of enemy warriors are swept away with a single swing, tanks and monstrous beasts swatted through the air like toys.

	<entry name="Tyranids/RavenerDescription" value="Хуткі звер, які створаны для блізкага бою."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/RavenerFlavor" value="Raveners are voracious predators, their clawed and snake-like bodies driven onwards by an all-consuming hunger. Twisted musculature grants these beasts a terrifying turn of speed. Raveners can bound over small obstacles in an eye-blink, dart between larger obstructions and even slither through flooded marshland with bewildering swiftness. The power housed within the Raveners' wiry forms allows them to burrow long distances beneath a world's surface, before emerging in a spray of earth right in front of an enemy position, claws eviscerating their ambushed prey whilst their thorax-mounted weapon symbiotes spit death."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ScythedHierodule" value="Касаносны ерадул"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ScythedHieroduleDescription" value="Спрытнае велізарнае стварэнне, якое рэжа цэлыя войскі."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ScythedHieroduleFlavor" value="The Scythed Hierodule was first recorded during the invasion of Hamman's World, a small Imperial colony close to one of the tendrils of Hive Fleet Kraken. Hamman's World was attacked soon after Kraken's defeat on Ichar IV as the hive fleet began to splinter. Nothing like the Hierodule has ever been reported before. It is armed with four huge razor-sharp claws, each capable of slicing clean through a battle tank, and heavily protected by chitin plates, in places up to 30 cm thick. A Hierodule is far larger than a Carnifex and is a monstrous-killing machine, even by Tyranid standards."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/SporeMine" value="Споравыя міны"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/SporeMineDescription" value="Павольная адзінка, якая выбухае пры кантакце з ворагам."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/SporeMineFlavor" value="Spore Mines have been known to drift for days, just waiting for an unwary foe to come near, before detonating with brutal effect."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Termagant" value="Тэрмагаўнты"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TermagantDescription" value="Асноўная пяхота."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TermagantFlavor" value="Termagants are agile and cunning creatures. They are amongst the smallest of the Hive Mind's warriors and were originally created to roam the arterial passages of bio-ships in search of intruders. In planetary invasions, Termagants scuttle forwards on four legs whilst unleashing torrents of fire from the anti-personnel bio-weaponry—commonly fleshborers—clutched in their clawed forelimbs."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tervigon" value="Тэрвігон"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TervigonDescription" value="Сінаптычны герой, які стварае войскі Тэрмагаўнтаў."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TervigonFlavor" value="The Tervigon is a massive synapse creature whose towering carapace shields a swollen abdomen. Though possessed of a formidable array of bio-weapons, from monstrous claws that crush any prey that ventures too close, to banks of razor-tipped spines that can be fired a considerable distance, the Tervigon's true threat lies within... Every Tervigon serves as a living incubator, within whose bloated form dozens upon dozens of Termagants slumber in a state of near-life. The Tervigon can spawn its dormant broods at will, jolting their minds into wakefulness."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Trygon" value="Трыгон"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TrygonDescription" value="Жахлівая істота, здольная ініцыяваць падземныя атакі."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TrygonFlavor" value="The Trygon is a vast serpentine creature, so colossal that it towers over even the mighty Carnifex. It is a heavily armoured monster, covered from head to tail with a thick carapace of shifting plates. As the Trygon moves, these plates generate a potent bio-static charge that courses along the length of the beast's body and wreathes its bladed forelimbs with crackling power. The Trygon can direct this energy as a lethal high-voltage discharge—unleashing pulsing arcs of lightning that leave its prey as little more than a charred pile of scorched bones."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tunnel" value="Вывадак вулля"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TunnelDescription" value="Дазваляе адзінкам пераходзіць з аднаго Вывадка Вулля ў іншы."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TunnelFlavor" value="Where the Tyranids arrive, the plants that constitute the Broodhive travel with them. Rapidly proliferating from seeds left by the Tyranid swarm as they pass, these plants burrow their giant hollow roots through soil, metal or stone, enabling Tyranids to pass undetected between areas."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyranidPrime" value="Гонар тыранідаў"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyranidPrimeDescription" value="Грозны сінаптычны герой, які ўзмацняе саюзных Ваяроў Тыранідаў."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyranidPrimeFlavor" value="Tyranid Primes are the apex of the Tyranid Warrior strain, faster, stronger and smarter than the other Warriors they lead to battle, who instinctively emulate their deadly skill."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Tyrannofex" value="Тыранафэкс"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyrannofexDescription" value="Жахлівая істота з далёкабойнай зброяй, якая знішчае нават самыя цяжкія машыны."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/TyrannofexFlavor" value="There can be little doubt that the massive Tyrannofex exists purely for destruction—it is a monster created for the most apocalyptic and gruelling of battlegrounds. Striding ominously towards their prey, these alien giants deal death from afar, shattering enemy battle lines with merciless salvos of bio-weapons fire. The only way to stop the unrelenting slaughter is to slay the beast, but a Tyrannofex has the fortitude of a living battle fortress and is heedless of all but the heaviest enemy ordnance. Clad in ablative layers of chitinous armour, a Tyrannofex is as unyielding as any war engine built of steel or born of conventional technology."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Warrior" value="Ваяры тыранідаў"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/WarriorDescription" value="Універсальная сінаптычная пяхота."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/WarriorFlavor" value="Tyranid Warriors are the most adaptable of all the Hive Mind's bioforms. They are creatures from the blackest of nightmares, unstoppable killing machines with pulsing ichor for blood, needle-sharp teeth and darkly gleaming eyes that reveal a terrible intelligence at work. A Tyranid Warrior stands twice the height of a man, its carapace protected by a thick chitin. One might expect such a creature to be slow in its actions, but a Tyranid Warrior is lithe, with reactions as swift as a whip."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/Zoanthrope" value="Заантропы"/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ZoanthropeDescription" value="Сінаптычная пяхота з разбуральнымі псіхічнымі магчымасцямі."/>
	<entry name="Tyranids/ZoanthropeFlavor" value="Zoanthropes are created solely to harness the psychic potential of the Hive Mind, and their entire bodies are perfected towards such a function. If necessary, a Zoanthrope can be used to extend the range of the Hive Mind's synaptic control, utilising the beast's vast cerebral capacity to relay its instructions to lesser creatures. A Zoanthrope's link to the synaptic web is such that, by flexing the merest part of its mind, it can rain incandescent power on the enemy, projecting destructive bolts of energy that boils through adamantium plate and disintegrates flesh with equal ease."/>
