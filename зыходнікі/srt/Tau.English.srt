1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,480
Never have the T’au been so close to extinction.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,320
Your homeworlds are surrounded.

3
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,400
The Swarm.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,640
The Machines.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,983
Men.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,440
To ensure the survival of the T’au,

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,983
your fleet was dispatched.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,980
The Fourth Expansion.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,983
To claim new, rich worlds.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Yet the warp swallowed us.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,480
Your ship emerged ...

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,983
alone.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,640
War-ravaged.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,983
Alien.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,983
This was not the paradise promised.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,400
But you will conquer it.

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,983
For the T’au.

18
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:56,980
For the Greater Good.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,783
For your survival.
