1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,120
Gladius Prime was a bastion of humanity,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,440
newly colonised.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,320
A suitable base for our Chapter to rebuild and recruit.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,740
We Space Marines raised our fortress here,

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,440
grew strong again.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,700
But the Ork invasion brought a warp storm

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,160
that cut off our Emperor's light.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,880
And the dread Necrons crawled from the earth beneath our feet.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,760
War was on all sides.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,740
Yet we are the Emperor's chosen.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,760
We do not dread the dark,

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,800
or quail at the relics of old.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,060
Terror is for those who oppose us!

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,400
We know no fear!
