1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,780
Few worlds were as pristine as Gladius Prime,

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,160
or so well-located.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,460
Soon after its discovery,

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,040
it grew into a rich Imperial world.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,320
Then the Orks landed...

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,260
and it burned.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:33,300
We, the men and women of the Astra Militarum,
answered the call, to battle the greenskin menace.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,660
Yet we died side-by-side with the Orks when the warp storms hit,
and the Necrons awoke.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,960
Whoever our foe, we will reclaim this world
and its ancient riches or we will die trying.

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,760
For mankind

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,240
and for the God-Emperor.
