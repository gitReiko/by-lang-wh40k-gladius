1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,467
Gladius Prime...

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,280
Adeptus Mechanicus first—

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,984
—what Hive World was not?

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,440
Its cities, its satellites, its wastes...

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,600
all created with Mars’ wisdom.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,560
All answering only to the Tech-Priests.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,640
That is, to you, Magos.

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,520
It was little work to hide your research into the Tyranids here,

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,880
deep beneath the ashen wastes.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,117
Disastrous, though it was.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,360
But you have followed the Omnissiah’s plans.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,440
And now is the time to finally execute on them.
