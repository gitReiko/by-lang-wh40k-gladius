1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,440
We were born into the War in Heaven.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,320
The war with no victors.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,160
Yet we survived.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,600
We thrived.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,980
We ruled for uncountable eons.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,400
This galaxy was ours.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,480
And we threw it away.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,600
In an excess of hedonism that tore reality apart,

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,980
we birthed a dark god.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,980
Into whose maw our people leapt.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,200
We are but the lingering mote of a golden empire.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,360
We will burn that flame brightly as long as we can.

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,320
We have carried it to Gladius Prime.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,980
There, the skeins of fate meet.

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,980
There is woven our future.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,480
There, we will solve its mystery.
