	<entry name="AegisHarnessDescription" value="Прадмет блакуе шкоду і эфекты ад наступнай псіхічнай атакі."/>
	<entry name="AegisHarnessFlavor" value="Imbued with psycho-conductive filaments and hexagrammic wards, Aegis armour represents perhaps the Imperium's most effective defence against psychic attack. Most commonly employed by the Inquisition's Ordo Malleus in their crusade to purge the taint of Chaos from the galaxy."/>
	<entry name="AdamantiumWeaveVest" value="Адамантыевы Тканая Камізэлька"/>
	<entry name="AdamantiumWeaveVestDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае браню."/>
	<entry name="AdamantiumWeaveVestFlavor" value="When you want to make something invulnerable, you make it from adamantium. Used in the construction of both Terminator Armour or the construction of Titans, this is the strongest material known to man. This vest only has a tiny amount in it, woven in with plasteel and ceramite, but it's enough to make it exceedingly protective."/>
	<entry name="ArmaplasBracers" value="Армапласавыя Наручы"/>
	<entry name="ArmaplasBracersDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае браню."/>
	<entry name="ArmaplasBracersFlavor" value="Made of the same material as the Imperial Carapace Armour, these matched sets of arm shields mildly increase the wearer's survivability. It's the built-in tactical cogitators, however, that give the wearer a much better hope of living through the next fight."/>
	<entry name="AxeOfBlindFury" value="Сякера Сьляпой Лютасьці"/>
	<entry name="AxeOfBlindFuryDescription" value="Прадмет дае эфект расьсяканьня ўсёй зброі блізкага бою."/>
	<entry name="AxeOfBlindFuryFlavor" value="Bound within this fabled axe is the essence of a Greater Daemon. It rages against its eternity of servitude, resulting in grievous violence against the enemy and, sometimes, its owner!"/>
	<entry name="BlightGrenade" value="Атрутная Граната"/>
	<entry name="BlightGrenadeDescription" value="Прадмет наносіць шкоду варожай адзінкі-цэлі. Дзейнічае на пяхоту і жахлівых стварэньняў."/>
	<entry name="BlightGrenadeFlavor" value="The use of the diseases contained in Blight Grenades was a war crime in ancient history. Modern examples are rare, but the Chaos Marines of Nurgle often create their own, with the shrapnel forcing lethal pathogens into the tiniest cracks in armour."/>
	<entry name="BlindGrenade" value="Асьляпляльная Граната"/>
	<entry name="BlindGrenadeDescription" value="Прадмет зьніжае дакладнасьць варожай адзінкі-цэлі. Дзейнічае на пяхоту і жахлівыя стварэньні."/>
	<entry name="BlindGrenadeFlavor" value="Blind grenades are a more complex version of a smoke grenade, releasing a dense dark grey smoke cloud, as well as infrared bafflers, broad spectrum electromagnetic radiation and chaff to disrupt enemy scanners. The broad range of interference makes most forms of direct attack through it impossible for a short time."/>
	<entry name="CombatStimulant" value="Баявы Стымулятар"/>
	<entry name="CombatStimulantDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае шкоду."/>
	<entry name="CombatStimulantFlavor" value="Combat Stimulants like Frenzon or Onslaught are regarded with distaste by most species, given that their manufacture and testing sometimes require the liquidation of innocent victims (especially if Slaaneshi cults are involved). Despite this, the Imperial forces dispense these regularly to both Penal Legions and the much-feared Eversor Assassins."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="Though the surface of Gladius was regularly scoured of useful materials and resources during its millenia of occupation, it still threw up unique items, attracting in its time many travelling traders, including the mysterious Jokaero. The recent ructions and warp storms have stirred its shattered surface further and thrown up all manner of strange items. Who knows what the Jokaero will find next?"/>
	<entry name="ConcealedWeaponSystem" value="Утоеная Сістэма Ўзбраеньня"/>
	<entry name="ConcealedWeaponSystemDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае атакі."/>
	<entry name="ConcealedWeaponSystemFlavor" value="Hiding a weapon isn't a new idea, but a true Concealed Weapon System secretes the killing tool in such a way that it's undetectable until use—as clothing, jewellery or even as biological elements. The element of surprise heavily increases its efficacy."/>
	<entry name="DimensionalKey" value="Прасторавы Ключ"/>
	<entry name="DimensionalKeyDescription" value="Прадмет, які дазваляе герою тэлепартавацца да дасьледаванай пліткі."/>
	<entry name="DimensionalKeyFlavor" value="This ancient key is carved from the thighbone of a Daemon Prince. When thrust into the heart of a dying warrior, it unlocks the barriers between worlds: a howling gale of Chaos blows, disorienting any nearby mortals not pledged to the Dark Gods. Worse still, the key guides those nearing the battlefield through the Warp."/>
	<entry name="DuskBlade" value="Змрочны Клінок"/>
	<entry name="DuskBladeDescription" value="Прадмет дае крадзеж жыцьця ўсёй зброі блізкага бою."/>
	<entry name="DuskBladeFlavor" value="The Dawn Blade that the traitor Commander Farsight discovered was unique—but to erase his memory Earth Caste artisans and Water Caste diplomats created this weapon for Coldflame. It may look the same as the iconic Dawn Blade, but it possesses none of its unearthly power—instead, the advanced medical technology embedded in it can draw on the battlesuit’s power to heal the wielder."/>
	<entry name="EnduranceImplant" value="Імплантат Трываласьці"/>
	<entry name="EnduranceImplantDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае рух."/>
	<entry name="EnduranceImplantFlavor" value="An atypical Jokaero device, this implant weaves its way into the host organism, to optimise its biological systems. Its user will find itself tireless, able to run faster, fight for longer, and generally keep going—until its overwrought body gives way, that is."/>
	<entry name="EntropicLocum" value="Энтрапічны Локум"/>
	<entry name="EntropicLocumDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае прабівальнасьць брані."/>
	<entry name="EntropicLocumFlavor" value="Apparently using similar design principles to a Graviton Gun, this Jokaero device can be used alongside a gunsight or parallel to a weapon’s blade. When activated, it causes the molecules in a very small volume of the target to become disordered and collapse inwards, leading to a single weak spot on the target that your weapon just happens to already be pointing at."/>
	<entry name="FaolchusWing" value="Крыло Фаольча"/>
	<entry name="FaolchusWingDescription" value="Прадмет спажывае дзеяньні для павелічэньня руху."/>
	<entry name="FaolchusWingFlavor" value="When Eldanesh fell battling Khaine, the great falcon Faolchú was disconsolate. Faolchú gifted a single golden pinfeather to Eldanesh’s heirs, that perhaps its swiftness might aid them where her own had failed. Legend tells that this artefact is that selfsame token of grief, handed down through generations of Aeldari, and surviving even the tumult of the Fall."/>
	<entry name="ForbiddenKnowledge" value="Забароненыя Веды"/>
	<entry name="ForbiddenKnowledgeDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае ўзровень."/>
	<entry name="ForbiddenKnowledgeFlavor" value="This box of black stone is heavily inscribed in ancient runes, possibly Exodite, possibly Old One. Who knows what it holds? Whispered secrets an aeon-old? Deadly traps? Miracles of knowledge long thought lost? Unholy power from unholy gods? Only a soul brave enough to open it and discover for themselves will ever know…"/>
	<entry name="JokaeroDigitalWeapon" value="Лічбавая Зброя Джакаэра"/>
	<entry name="JokaeroDigitalWeaponDescription" value="Прадмет наносіць шкоду варожай адзінкі-цэлі."/>
	<entry name="JokaeroDigitalWeaponFlavor" value="Miniaturized killing tools of remarkable power, commonly concealed within jewellery, and created by a race of primate-like xenos with an apparently instinctive understanding of technology. The Imperium has, as yet, been unable to replicate the construction of these digi-weapons."/>
	<entry name="LaurelsOfCommand" value="Лаўры Камандаваньня"/>
	<entry name="LaurelsOfCommandDescription" value="Прадмет аднаўляе мараль гэтай адзінкі і суседніх хаўрусных адзінак у радыусе."/>
	<entry name="LaurelsOfCommandFlavor" value="The Laurels of Command are a callous and controversial means to ensure obedience. Concealed within their peerless artistry is a band of empathic-impulsion circuitry which allows the wearer limited control over the minds of indoctrinated individuals via subliminal suggestion. Under their effects even cowards fight to the last, while orders are executed in perfect synchronisation."/>
	<entry name="LightningGauntlet" value="Рукавіцы Маланак"/>
	<entry name="LightningGauntletDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае шкоду ад наступнай атакі блізкага бою."/>
	<entry name="LightningGauntletFlavor" value="With talons created from adamantium and the telltale blue glow of a power weapon, Lightning Claws are normally only mounted on Terminator armour. However rare single gauntlets can be found small enough to be carried by a normal warrior."/>
	<entry name="ManCatcher" value="Лавец Людзей"/>
	<entry name="ManCatcherDescription" value="Прадмет зьменшвае рух варожай адзінкі-цэлі."/>
	<entry name="ManCatcherFlavor" value="An ancient capture device whose spiked collar violently dissuades its prisoner from attempting escape, and may loosen their tongue to boot. Though most consider it too primitive a weapon, a handful of Inquisitors are resolute that its simple barbarism achieves results that more contemporary methods simply cannot."/>
	<entry name="MourningBladeOfLazaerek" value="Клінок Жальбы Лазарыка"/>
	<entry name="MourningBladeOfLazaerekDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае шкоду і прабіваньне брані ў блізкім баі."/>
	<entry name="MourningBladeOfLazaerekFlavor" value="Little survived when an apparently disastrous jump saw the last remnants of the Fire Hawks Chapter lost to the warp in 963.M41, but a few alleged relics yet remain. This axe was thought to belong to their rancorous grand master, Stibor Lazaerek, under whose command the Chapter's ranks were decimated during the lethal rebellions of the Badab War."/>
	<entry name="OmniScope" value="Амніскоп"/>
	<entry name="OmniScopeDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае трапнасьць далёкага бою."/>
	<entry name="OmniScopeFlavor" value="A rare Imperial weapon sight, the Omni-Scope consists of a precision lens aligned to a cluster of sensors, including telescopic and multi-spectrum vision modes. The user can either use the sight manually or through a direct input that plugs into bionics, biologics or other interfaces. The latter interface enables remote sight and control with any weapon—making it favoured by assassins Imperium-wide."/>
	<entry name="PoweredBolas" value="Зараджаны Болас"/>
	<entry name="PoweredBolasDescription" value="Прадмет зьменшвае рух варожай адзінкі-цэлі."/>
	<entry name="PoweredBolasFlavor" value="On the Imperium's savannah worlds, the local forces often adopt these traditional devices, taken from the local Grox herders. The three-powered weights at the end of the wire do little harm to the target—but so thoroughly entangle it that it can be dealt with at leisure."/>
	<entry name="PoweredGauntlet" value="Зараджаная Рукавіца"/>
	<entry name="PoweredGauntletDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае шкоду ў блізкім баі."/>
	<entry name="PoweredGauntletFlavor" value="This may look like a simple steel glove, with randomly-placed technology all over it. Yet, as the Administratum say, 'caveat emptor'—for the Jokaero technology in it makes it the match of the larger power fists and power claws employed by the Imperial and Ork forces."/>
	<entry name="RecoveryPackage" value="Пакет Аднаўленьня"/>
	<entry name="RecoveryPackageDescription" value="Прадмет аднаўляе здароўе."/>
	<entry name="RecoveryPackageFlavor" value="This medkit has been thrown together with little sense or reason, perhaps by a Jokaero or an Ork Mad Dok with an instinctive sense of medicine, but there's no doubting the efficacy of its contents. Whatever the injury, there's a neatly-mislabelled package in here that will fix it."/>
	<entry name="ScrollsOfMagnus" value="Скруткі Магнуса"/>
	<entry name="ScrollsOfMagnusDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае вытворчасьць дасьледваньняў."/>
	<entry name="ScrollsOfMagnusFlavor" value="These illuminated pages of skin are fragments of the repository of sorcery compiled by the Primarch of the Thousand Sons, and contain arcane lore from across the galaxy. None possess them for long and remain sane, for they have their own ghastly sentience."/>
	<entry name="SightlessHelm" value="Бязвокі Шалом"/>
	<entry name="SightlessHelmDescription" value="Прадмет дае здольнасьць ігнараваць зьніжэньне шкоды далёкага бою і павялічвае трапнасьць далёкага бою."/>
	<entry name="SightlessHelmFlavor" value="The lenses of this helm remain forever dark, the wearer unable to perceive the galaxy with their own eyes. Instead, strange warp senses are granted by the helms machine spirit, illuminating the foe’s weaknesses."/>
	<entry name="StunGrenade" value="Аглушальная Граната"/>
	<entry name="StunGrenadeDescription" value="Прадмет часова забараняе варожай пяхоце або жахліваму стварэньню дзейнічаць."/>
	<entry name="StunGrenadeFlavor" value="An ancient design, Stun grenades use a combination of a loud explosion and a bright flash to temporarily disable any combatants in the blast area."/>
	<entry name="TantalisingIcon" value="Абраз Дражніны"/>
	<entry name="TantalisingIconDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае вытворчасьць уплыву."/>
	<entry name="TantalisingIconFlavor" value="Carved from wraithbone stolen from the hearts of fallen Craftworlds, this elongated form represents Slaanesh in all their glory. Few mortal eyes could rest upon this icon and not lust for it—for Slaanesh—and begin their fall from grace."/>
	<entry name="TemporaryShield" value="Часавы Шчыт"/>
	<entry name="TemporaryShieldDescription" value="Прадмет, які павялічвае браню."/>
	<entry name="TemporaryShieldFlavor" value="Portable shield generators are fairly rare amongst most species, given the technical capability and rare resources needed to make them. They also burn out quickly, but their ability to stop even the most powerful attacks dead in their tracks make them invaluable."/>
	<entry name="UltraWidebandAuspex" value="Ультра Шырокапалосны Аўсьпекс"/>
	<entry name="UltraWidebandAuspexDescription" value="Гэты прадмет не дае нападаць атакам назіраньня."/>
	<entry name="UltraWidebandAuspexFlavor" value="To hide yourself, you don’t always need diffraction fields or chameleonic skin—sometimes just knowing more than the enemy is enough. An advanced Auspex uses passive and active sensors to discern the location of every enemy unit so the bearer can decide how best to engage them—or avoid them—at will."/>
	<entry name="UncreatorGauntlet" value="Пальчатка Нястваральніка"/>
	<entry name="UncreatorGauntletDescription" value="Прадмет рамантуе суседнюю хаўрусную машыну ці фартыфікацыю."/>
	<entry name="UncreatorGauntletFlavor" value="The Uncreator Gauntlet was originally devised to reverse-engineer lost technologies. When laid upon a machine, xenotech fields are released that cause the construct’s chronology to be wound back. If the timing is accurate to the picosecond, the temporal anomaly can rejuvenate the machine to the prime of its operative lifespan – or go on to reduce it to a neatly-arrayed pile of component parts, each ready for the Tech-Priest’s inspection."/>
	<entry name="VolcanisShroud" value="Покрыва Вулкана"/>
	<entry name="VolcanisShroudDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае зьніжэньне шкоды ад вядзьмарскага агоню."/>
	<entry name="VolcanisShroudFlavor" value="Though this battered, heat-resistant armour was originally designed for industrial work at the deepest and most hazardous layers of Hive Worlds, by some happy accident it also muffles psychic attack. As yet, whatever gives the Shroud this quality has not been identified, for fear that reverse-engineering it may break its uncanny spell."/>
	<entry name="ZoatHideJerkin" value="Куртка са Скуры Зоата"/>
	<entry name="ZoatHideJerkinDescription" value="Прадмет павялічвае здароўе і хуткасьць лячэньня."/>
	<entry name="ZoatHideJerkinFlavor" value="The Zoat, a genetically-engineered slave race in the thrall of the Tyranids, have been all but absent from the galaxy for generations. Though renowned for their unusual intelligence and charisma, their dense, scaled skin also made them a frighteningly resilient foe. Zoat-hide armour is vanishingly rare now, but a true boon upon the battlefield."/>
