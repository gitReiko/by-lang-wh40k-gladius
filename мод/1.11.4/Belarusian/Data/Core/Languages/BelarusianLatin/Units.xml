Their quest is to locate the Motive Force that animates all things, rip it from the bodies of the unworthy in the heat of battle, and hoard it on behalf of the Machine God. To do so they use electroleech staves – eldritch weapons that suck the bioelectricity from living creatures, drawing it out in one great draught and harnessing it within their core capacitors. Once stolen, that sacred energy can be used to power the holy instead of the heretical, crackling around them in such measure it can even burn away incoming projectiles."/>

Utterly deadly at close quarters, they are not born so much as constructed, their every enhancement geared for maximum lethality. They are easily recognised by their growling motive units, vicious hydraulic pincers and deadly shoulder-mounted cannons. Yet the most vital component of all is within – the soul of a violent man. In battle Kataphron Breachers rumble forward at the command of their Tech-Priest masters, fulfilling the role of living shield and battering ram alike. Originally devised to break apart enemy battle lines and fortifications, they are of great use to those adepts who wish to seize a valuable artefact from the clutches of would-be usurpers."/>

From its avenger gatling cannon it levels a fusillade of heavy shells, sketching deadly patterns across the enemy armys frontage.

Swivelling in response to their predictive auto-auguries, the Icarus cannons spit streams of flak fire into the skies to detonate enemy aircraft in distant fireballs.

These unstoppable cyborgs do not rest until the bloody deed is done, for they are driven ever onward by the imperative to locate their foes and ensure their destruction. They do this not in Drop Pod strikes launched from above, nor by sudden teleportation into the midst of the enemy, but by stalking their quarry over the course of weeks or even months until it can run no more. Once the designated target is in their crosshairs the air fills with the thump and crackle of galvanic weaponry, even as the Skitarii continue their relentless advance.

Their baroque carbines fill the air around the foe with harmful emanations, corrupting the atmosphere itself even as they punch hyper-irradiated shot into the flesh of their victims."/>

Over the ten thousand years since the Long War began, the Rhino has seen continued use as the favoured transport of the Chaos Space Marines.

The teams' strides shake the ground, and their jump jets roar thunderously as they make long, dynamic bounds across the war zone. Foes quail in horror as the massive suits swings their heads in their direction, the pilots and their networked Als bringing their mighty arsenals to bear. With a rising whine, the Riptides' nova reactors power up, a momentary glow gathering around the battlesuits' jutting guns before they turn the world to fire and light."/>

Psychic energy can be visibly seen crackling along these structures. In combat, it uses them to focus its psychic powers and draw all the life-energy from its surroundings.

Able to move swiftly and without sound through even the densest terrain, and concealed by a chameleonic carapace that renders it all but invisible to the naked eye, a Lictor can remain hidden until it chooses to strike.

On those few occasions that a survivor has seen a Malanthrope and somehow escaped, they have brought with them a tale of horror. They report seeing these giants drift across corpse-strewn battlefields, but unlike other Tyranids, which mindlessly devour everything in their way, Malanthropes seem to selectively search through the slain—as to what they are searching for, none can say."/>

It is armed with four huge razor-sharp claws, each capable of slicing clean through a battle tank, and heavily protected by chitin plates, in places up to 30 cm thick.

The only way to stop the unrelenting slaughter is to slay the beast, but a Tyrannofex has the fortitude of a living battle fortress and is heedless of all but the heaviest enemy ordnance.
