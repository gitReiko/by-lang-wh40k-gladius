	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="AdeptusMechanicusCityFlavor" value="A proto-Hive, the Adeptus Mechanicus make their home here. Everything moves, everything is a machine, nothing is natural or soft or clean. It is a place not designed for the comfort of man—the flesh is weak after all—but here the teeming mass of humanity live short, sad lives in the shadows of sacred and mighty machines."/>
	<entry name="Arctic" value="Арктыка"/>
	<entry name="ArcticFlavor" value="On most human-habitable planets, the icy, treeless 'arctic' climates are located towards the poles of the planet. On Gladius Prime, however, ancient climate management means the frozen regions are less predictably-distributed."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumCity" value="Горад Астра Мілітарум"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarumCityFlavor" value="Humans are crammed into this city's high walls, but that doesn't mean their behaviour is confined to it. For miles around, the landscape is devastated, polluted and exploited, whilst the various human workers, machines and soldiers roam further, to truly 'terraform' the planet's once-fertile surface."/>
	<entry name="Bedrock" value="Карэнная Парода"/>
	<entry name="BedrockDescription" value=""/>
	<entry name="BedrockFlavor" value="Over the millenia, Gladius Prime's foliage, fauna and habitat has changed drastically—but no change so drastic as that effected by the Tyranids. In this area, not only has the wildlife and the foliage been consumed, but the Ripper swarms have dug up the soil, subsoil and regolith, leaving only bare stone behind. Give the Tyranids enough time and the whole planet will be like this."/>

	<entry name="Brush" value="Хмызьняк"/>
	<entry name="BrushFlavor" value="This low scrubland is scattered with the detritus and debris from human habitation, and xenos invasion. It might not be attractive to the eye, but it's fertile enough for basic subsistence."/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesCity" value="Горад Касьмічных Марынаў Хаосу"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="ChaosSpaceMarinesCityFlavor" value="Life here is short. Born in the Slave Mills, only the strongest endure the Slaaneshis’ agonizing sacrifices, survive the Khornate hunting parties, escape Nurgle’s pandemics and are used by Tzeentch’s all-seeing plans without being destroyed. And, in this prison of a city, no-one survives all of this for long, intact or uncorrupted."/>

	<entry name="Coast" value="Узьбярэжжа"/>
	<entry name="CoastFlavor" value="Here sits the ruin of an Imperial fishery; there, the abandoned summer villa of a ranking Imperium bureaucrat; there, a camp of desperate, feral human survivors, eking out an existence from the ocean's bounty."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="Gladius I has seen many civilisations rise and fall in its 4 billion years of galactic existence. First the Necrontyr made their home here, then the Old Ones and their Aeldari successors militarised the surface against the Necrons' return. In more recent years, it was a young Imperium Hive World, before the coming of the Orks. Little wonder that the surface of the planet still shows that disruption—torn asunder, and littered with the relics of the past as it is…"/>

	<entry name="EldarCity" value="Штучны Сьвет Аэльдары"/>
	<entry name="EldarCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="EldarCityFlavor" value="This construction is not here to stay, yet it has more craftsmanship in it than anything else on the planet. Woven into existence by Bonesingers on the Path of the Artisan, it is as functional as it is delicate. The attenuated strands of Wraithbone croon ancient harmonies as they are warmed by the rising of Gladius’ star. All this surrounding a gateway to the immaterium itself."/>
	<entry name="DesertFlavor" value="In these bare regions, precipitation is so low as to make life impossible, save for slow-growing extremophiles and the most alien anhydrous lifeforms. The clear land and skies are perfect for solar-capture devices, however."/>
	<entry name="FermentationPool" value="Ферментацыйны Басейн"/>
	<entry name="FermentationPoolDescription" value="Асаблівасьць павялічвае хуткасьць узросту горада, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="FermentationPoolFlavor" value="This apparently-natural water source looks welcoming to any wildlife—but woe betide any thirsty Grox that wanders by. The pool's unusual bacteria rot down the planet's plant life and concentrates the runoff into something lethally-intoxicating. More advanced races can collect and refine the liquid, for trade or entertaining consumption."/>
	<entry name="Forest" value="Лес"/>
	<entry name="ForestFlavor" value="Gladius' fast-growing forests persist all year around, the vegetal growth stretching to the sky, and blocking lines of sight. Gladius' plants may seem treelike, but they're actually iron-hard, as they draw ores from deep under the planet's surface."/>
	<entry name="Grassland" value="Паша"/>
	<entry name="GrasslandFlavor" value="Whether natural plains or once-inhabited regions scoured clean by unholy warp energies, these rolling fields are the most fertile places on the planet, perfect for Imperium-approved crops."/>

	<entry name="GroxPastureDescription" value="Асаблівасьць якая павялічвае ежу ці паборы ў горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="GroxPastureFlavor" value="Around heatstones alien storytellers muse about the Grox—the dangerous herd animal that is ubiquitous throughout human lands. Wherever man goes, the hardy Grox travels with him or is there before him. Some joke that the Grox was the Old Ones' most successful creation."/>
	<entry name="HolySite" value="Сьвятое Месца Сарорытас"/>
	<entry name="HolySiteDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, што дае ўзнагароду першай адзінцы Шпітальерак, якая ўвайшла на плітку."/>
	<entry name="HolySiteFlavor" value="The Tabernacles of the Adepta Sororitas are not merely holy sites—they also house relics of ancient Sisters, weapons, armour and valuable tactical advice. In times of dire need, the Sisters may take them up again and use them in war…"/>
	<entry name="ImperialRuin" value="Імперскія Руіны"/>
	<entry name="ImperialRuinFlavor" value="The pre-invasion human colony was built for defense and mineral exploitation. Nothing was designed to stand the tectonic shifts and warp-born horrors that came with the Ork invasion, and hence very few structures weathered it. This ruin is a rare survivor."/>
	<entry name="JokaeroTraderEncampment" value="Лагер Гандляроў Джакаэра"/>
	<entry name="JokaeroTraderEncampmentDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая дазваляе героям на гэтай клетцы набываць і прадаваць прадметы. Таксама асаблівасьць павялічвае вытворчасьць уплыву ў горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="JokaeroTraderEncampmentFlavor" value="If you have little regard for your life and seek excitement, visit the Jokaero. Imbued with an instinctive technical creativity that exceeds even that of an Ork Mekboy, these orange-furred aliens resemble a great Terran ape but can create wonders beyond imagining—the challenge is in acquiring them and safely working out what they do…"/>

	<entry name="NecronsCity" value="Горад Некронаў"/>
	<entry name="NecronsCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="NecronsCityFlavor" value="Insane obelisks, mastabas and half-buried crypts make this sprawling city resemble an ancient human necropolis. Yet it is far from deserted, instead filled with the soulless Necrons—warriors and machines of living metal that regard other sentient races as at best a source of slaves, and at worst a plague to be wiped from existence."/>
	<entry name="NecronTomb" value="Грабніца Некронаў"/>
	<entry name="NecronTombDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая дазваляе Некронам засноўваць горад на гэтай клетцы."/>
	<entry name="NecronTombFlavor" value="Deep beneath this innocuous patch of land lies a Tomb City, where the Necrons have slept away the long millenia. To one who knows the correct protocols, it's a simple matter to begin the procedure of awakening it and its inhabitants from their dreamless sleep…"/>
	<entry name="Ocean" value="Акіян"/>
	<entry name="OceanFlavor" value="Who knows what treasures have been swept into Gladius' mighty seas? What long-lost artefacts lie crusted with coral amidst its deep-ocean smokers and light-fearing sea aberrations? Given the richness of the land, no-one has ever explored these questions."/>
	<entry name="OreField" value="Радовішча Руды"/>
	<entry name="OreFieldDescription" value="Асаблівасьць якая павялічвае вытворчасьць руды ці паборы ў горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="OreFieldFlavor" value="Few places on an inhabited world still have mineral-rich rocks simply lying around on the surface. Yet here, the ruptures of the warp storm have torn great chunks from the planet's surface, allowing for easy exploitation by whichever faction finds it first."/>
	<entry name="OrkoidFungus" value="Оркоідныя Грыбы"/>
	<entry name="OrkoidFungusDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая павялічвае вытворчасьць ежы і лечыць Оркаў."/>

	<entry name="OrksCity" value="Горад Оркаў"/>
	<entry name="OrksCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="OrksCityFlavor" value="This monstrous shanty town barely merits the name of city, when placed alongside the structures of other races, but it is the closest that the Orks ever get to an urban existence. Battered plates of scavenged metal and stone surround a junkyard filled with crude fighting pits, deep sumps, and pungent mushrooms."/>
	<entry name="Outpost" value="Аванпост"/>
	<entry name="OutpostDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая дае невялікі бонус рэсурсаў кантралюючаму гульцу."/>
	<entry name="OutpostFlavor" value="The long history of Gladius Prime has left the planet dotted with a wide range of geology, flora and fauna from across the known galaxy. To take advantage of the useful ones, most civilisations establish a small group responsible for maintenance and gathering and a temporary outpost to house them."/>
	<entry name="PromethiumRelayPipes" value="Трубы Здабычы Праметыума"/>
	<entry name="PromethiumRelayPipesDescription" value="Асаблівасьць якая павялічвае вытворчасьць энергіі ў горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="PromethiumRelayPipesFlavor" value="These heavily-armoured ducts once carried energy-rich promethium to the planet's extensive human cities from deeply-buried auto-refineries. Now, with the cities in ruins from war and chaos, the surviving pipes can be exploited by whichever race claims them first."/>
	<entry name="RecafLeaf" value="Лісьце Рэкаф"/>
	<entry name="RecafLeafDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая павялічвае лаяльнасьць у горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="RecafLeafFlavor" value="These humble fields of wild herbs hide a secret—a rich food and narcotic stimulant that allows organic races to go without sleep or rest for great periods of time. Called 'Recaf' by humans, it's collected, processed and distributed to factory workers and slaves to greatly improve their output."/>
	<entry name="River" value="Рака"/>
	<entry name="RiverFlavor" value="This freshwater watercourse wends its way to the sea, concentrating the wealth of mountains and fields as it does. Infantry regiments are less interested in the river's bounty and more in its capabilities as a natural defensive line."/>
	<entry name="Rocks" value="Горныя Пароды"/>
	<entry name="RocksFlavor" value="Thrust up by the planet's seismic hell, these freshly-revealed crags might be bare of organic life, but are a superb source of the rare minerals at Gladius' heart."/>
	<entry name="Ruin" value="Руіны Ваула"/>
	<entry name="RuinDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая дае ўзнагароду першай адзінцы, якая наведвае клетку, і павялічвае вытворчасьць дасьледаваньняў у горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="RuinFlavor" value="It's unclear what this is—some time-worn structure rearing up from the shattered surface, made from the same impenetrable material as the rare artefacts that dot the planet. Much can be learned merely from studying it—and perhaps it still houses some secrets itself."/>
	<entry name="Savanna" value="Савана"/>
	<entry name="SavannaFlavor" value="Mixed woodland and grassland proliferates here, atop the inevitable human and xenos ruins, making for a landscape that's both fertile and home to the planet's unique ore-rich 'trees'."/>
	<entry name="Shard" value="Асколак Ваула"/>
	<entry name="ShardDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая павялічвае вытворчасьць ці паборы руды і энергіі ў горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="ShardFlavor" value="Before the warpstorm, when man ruled the planet, these great outcrops were a curiosity and an attraction, like Cadia's pylons. Yet whilst the warpstorm rages overhead, they tremble with an unkind power that foolhardy races may seek to tap."/>

	<entry name="SistersOfBattleCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="SistersOfBattleCityFlavor" value="A city built for two purposes: to be a monument to the Emperor of mankind’s divinity; and to be a bastion of his holy warriors, the Adepta Sororitas. The wellbeing of the many short-lived humans who toil beneath its spires is very much a tertiary concern…"/>
	<entry name="SkullAltar" value="Алтар Чарапоў"/>
	<entry name="SkullAltarDescription" value="Асаблівасьць, якая дае ўзнагароду адзінцы, якая наведвае клетку, і павялічвае вытворчасьць уплыву ў горадзе, калі апрацоўваецца."/>
	<entry name="SkullAltarFlavor" value="Rising from the ground, the Skull Altar is formed out of the violent tributes heaped in offering for Khorne's Throne. From atop the grisly pedestal a priest of Khorne roars out invectives, evoking the judgements of the Blood God to smite down all signs of weakness."/>

	<entry name="SpaceMarinesCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="SpaceMarinesCityFlavor" value="Where other races have cities, the Space Marines have their solitary fortress-monastery—a bastion of their kind, part-chapel, part-armoury, where new Adeptus Astartes are recruited and altered using the age-old and pitiless techniques devised by the Emperor himself."/>
	<entry name="TauCity" value="Горад Т'ау"/>
	<entry name="TauCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="TauCityFlavor" value="This is the nearest any citizen of the galaxy can get to utopia—an open welcoming city of elegant construction, where every species can live in comfort and studious peace—even man. Sad, then, that it has been built on Gladius Prime, surrounded by hostile aliens determined to wipe the T’au and their allies out."/>

	<entry name="Tundra" value="Тундра"/>
	<entry name="TundraFlavor" value="A stark landscape dominates here, where short growing seasons and low temperatures offered only a bitter existence for the erstwhile human settlers. Food can still be found here, but hydroponic or intensive systems are required for survival."/>
	<entry name="TyranidsCity" value="Горад Тыранідаў"/>
	<entry name="TyranidsCityDescription" value="<string name='Traits/CityDescription'/>"/>
	<entry name="TyranidsCityFlavor" value="To call this a city is a strange act. What would you call a group of leviathan symbiotic organisms, clustered in one place and infested by smaller creatures, with the intelligence of a Norn Queen guiding it all? This is more a person and its limbs than a city—but if there's one thing common to all the galaxy's races, it's that they interpret everything modelled after their own experience. To man, then, this is a city."/>
	<entry name="Volcanic" value="Вулканічная Парода"/>
	<entry name="VolcanicFlavor" value="Here, the massive sub-surface pressure triggered by the warp chaos has created seismic eruptions on the surface. For those races willing to risk their lives (or their slaves' lives), it's a rich area for ore exploitation."/>

	<entry name="WireWeedFlavor" value="Woe betide anyone who wanders into these thickets of brambles. Slowly at first, but faster and faster, the living weed draws its razor-sharp filaments tighter around the hapless intruder."/>
