1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,440
Life is worthless without Faith.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,720
Faith in the God-Emperor.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,120
Faith ...

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,520
that he will save mankind.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,040
The Adepta Sororitas are the guardians of that faith.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,440
These people were our people.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,360
And when the world was lost, when the cities fell.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,960
We defended them from the Xenos.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,680
The heretics.

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,880
But soon, we stood against the dark.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,640
Alone…

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,560
others would have lost hope.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,800
But not the Adepta Sororitas.

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,560
And finally, our faith was rewarded.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,320
With the blessed Celestine at our head.

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,840
We will save these people.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,640
For the God-Emperor!
