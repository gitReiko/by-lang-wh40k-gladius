1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
For aeons... we waited.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,280
Waited for new life to cover our world -

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,660
life weak with the warp's taint.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,840
The time was... ripe.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,460
Ripe to wake.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,400
To finally defeat the Old Ones.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,880
To take the galaxy for ourselves.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,880
Our old enemies left us a gift -

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,440
one that tore the planet apart

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,420
and trapped us here.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,620
This is a rude awakening.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,280
But this planet shall learn

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,060
to fear the Necrons again.
